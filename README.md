# NYU Project Highlights

Some creative projects I did in the NYU Publishing program!
<br>

_In alphabetical order—_

## Book Marketing and Branding, Spring 25
First time working with an ARC...! Created a marketing & publicity plan for _A Year with the Seals_ (Algonquin Books, 2025). The presentation was short, but I indeed made full marketing & publicity plan!

## Capstone Project, Fall 25
A Cantonese learning site. See [/`NYUCapstone-KongTone`/](https://github.com/kelly990918/NYUCapstone-KongTone) for more.

## Digital Financials: Web, Mobile and Emerging Platforms, Fall 24
Acting as the VP of Subscription & Ecommerce Department, I designed a tiered subscription plan, and discovered multiple ecomm opportunities through merch, affiliation, and mircopayments for **LRT**, a luxury running app. We're making some money!

## Exploring UI Design, Fall 25
Re-designing the [books.com.tw](https://www.books.com.tw/)（博客來）site! Aiming to decluster the site, create a better browsing/ searching experience for users, also a _true_ English site.

## Introduction to Marketing and Branding, Spring 24
Made a marketing plan for **The Night Hawkers**, the new digital magazine for Asian food and traveling. It was my first time designing a magazine cover!

## Managing a Digital Brand, Fall 25
Created a pitch deck for **Philatelic Asia**, a fully digital site covering philatelic news from Asia. There's nothing quite like that in the market, focusing on delivering Asian stamp news for the English readers. Perhaps it doesn't exist for a reason, because it's too niche to be sustained(?)

## Publishing Start-Ups: Strategies for Success, Spring 25
A start-up analysis for [Codédex](https://www.codedex.io/), a coding self-learning site. I really like their pixel art design.
- 🌟 [Presentation](https://github.com/kelly990918/NYU-Highlights/blob/main/start-up.pdf)

## Web Design: From HTML to Web Destinations, Fall 24
Designed and created **College Travelers**, an alternative platform for major travel sites filled with ads. Hand-coded HTML site with some debugging help from Grok.
